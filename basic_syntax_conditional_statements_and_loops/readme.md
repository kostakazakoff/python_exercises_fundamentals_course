Lab: Basic Syntax, Conditional Statements, and Loops



1. Number Definer

Write a program that reads a floating-point number and:
- prints "zero" if the number is zero
- prints "positive" or "negative"
- adds "small" if the absolute value of the number is less than 1 and it is not 0, or "large" if it exceeds 1 000 000


2. Largest of Three Numbers

Write a program that receives three whole numbers and prints the largest one.


3. Word Reverse

Write a program that receives a single word, reverses it, and prints it.


4. Even Numbers

Write a program that receives a number n on the first line. On the following n lines, it receives different integer numbers.
If the program receives an odd number, print "{num} is odd!" and end the program. Otherwise, if all numbers given are even, print "All numbers are even.".
  
  
5. Number Between 1 and 100

Write a program that reads different floating-point numbers from the console.
 When it receives a number between 1 and 100 inclusive, the program should stop reading and should print "The number {number} is between 1 and 100".
  
  
6. Shopping

Write a program that reads an integer number representing a budget. On the following lines, it reads integer numbers representing the prices of each product you should buy until it receives the command "End".
During the iterations, if there is not enough budget left to buy the next product, it prints "You went in overdraft!" and end the program.
Otherwise, if you accomplished to buy all products before receiving "End", it prints "You bought everything needed."
  
  
7. Patterns

Write a program that receives a number and creates the following pattern. The number represents the largest count of stars on one row.


8. Drink Something
Kids drink toddy, teens drink coke, young adults drink beer, and adults drink whisky. Create a program that receives a person's age and prints what he/she drinks.
Rules:
- A kid is defined as someone under or at the age of 14.
- A teen is defined as someone under or at the age of 18.
- A young adult is defined as someone under or at the age of 21.
- An adult is defined as someone above the age of 21.
Note: All the values are inclusive except the last one!
